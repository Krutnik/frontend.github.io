                    <h3>Ice hockey</h3>
                    <p>Ice hockey game between the Barrie Colts and the Brampton Battalion Main article: Ice hockey Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc called a puck. This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice. The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world. It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia and the national winter sport of Canada. Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ag 
                    <p>The governing body of international play is the 77-member International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. Women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories. International ice hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s.</p>
                
                    <p>The contemporary sport developed in Canada from European and native influences.      These   included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks. These were played outdoors on ice under the name "hockey" in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names. In Canada, there are 24 reports of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 (five of them using the name "hockey"). The first organized and recorded game of ice hockey was played indoors in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on March 3, 1875, and featured several McGill University students.</p>
                
                    <p>Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can legally curve either way, for left- or right-handed players.</p>

                    <p>Board game is a game based on the manipulation of a relatively small set of objects that can fit entirely on the table or in the hands of the players. Board games include games with a special field, card games, dice, soldiers and others. Games of this category, unlike sports and video games, do not require active movement of players, additional technically complex equipment or special structures, playgrounds, fields, etc.</p>

                        <p>Darwin's theory This is Evolution, a board game about survival and adaptation in the face of constant competition between species. The game is the world's most unusual biology textbook. But this does not mean that she is boring! Herbivores will go to any adaptation possibilities in order to escape from predators, and predators will take measures in response to eat these herbivores. Your creatures will be weighed and combined in the course of the game with useful evolutionary properties. This can be the size of the creature, its ability to swim, disguise and survive. This is how the waterfowl poisonous killer rabbits turn out in the course of the game! You will see all this in the new Russian game called Evolution!</p>
